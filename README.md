> Template helper for generating a list of links to the homepages of related GitHub/npm projects.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save helper-related
```

## What does this do?

This is a template helper that takes an array of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package names, and returns a list of formatted links with the `description` from each package.

## Usage

This is an async helper that should work with any [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) based application.

**Register the helper**

```js
app.helper('related', require('helper-related'));
```

**Use in templates**

```js
{%= related(['remarkable', 'micromatch']) %}
```

Results in a list that looks something like:

```markdown

```

If the array gets long, you can either format it like this:

```js
{%= related([
  'git-branch', 
  'git-repo-name', 
  'git-user-email', 
  'git-user-name', 
  'git-username', 
  'github-repo-url'
]) %}   
```

Or pass the list as a variable on the context:

```js
{%= related(verb.related.list) %}   
```
